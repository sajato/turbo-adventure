# Contributing Guidelines

## Sumission Guidelines

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Make your changes in a new git branch

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```
* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format).

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```

  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `atomfrede/turbo-adventure:master`.
* If we suggest changes then
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the JHipster tests on your sample generated project to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```
#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```
    
## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have rules over how our git commit messages must be formatted.

### <a name="commit-message-format"></a> Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on Github as well as in various git tools.

### Header
The Header contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

###Body
If your change is simple, the Body is optional.

Just as in the Header, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

###Footer
The footer is the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

You **must** use the [Github keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) for
automatically closing the issues referenced in your commit.

### Example
For example, here is a good commit message:

```
upgrade to mongo-db-driver 3

upgraded to the latest mongo java driver

Fix #1234
```
